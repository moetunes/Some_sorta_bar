some_sorta_bar
A simple bar to display the root window name for lightweight window managers.
Colours are set at compile time so edit them to suit.
The first colour is the background and the following eight are for the text.
To change the colour mark the text with an ampersand and the desired colour number.
e.g. To use the first and last colours mark the text like -
&0 some text &7 some more text
.
Font is set at compile time and the height of the bar is relevant to the font height.
The window manager might need it's space for a bar adjusted.
